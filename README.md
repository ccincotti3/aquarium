# Aquarium

This 3D aquarium is a creative exercise I took on, where I created 3D models in blender, and rendered them to the screen using Three.js. The objective was to familiarize myself with Three.js, but also to understand what it takes to render 3D objects to a screen. I also introduced myself to shaders.
